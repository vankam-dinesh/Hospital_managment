# Hospital Management System (Java & MySQL)

## Overview

The **Hospital Management System** is a simple command-line application designed to manage patients, doctors, and appointments using Java and MySQL. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations, database connectivity, and interaction between Java and MySQL. This project serves as a learning tool for understanding the integration of Java with MySQL.

## Features

1. **Add Patients:** Allows adding patient details to the database.
2. **View Patients:** Displays a list of all patients stored in the database.
3. **View Doctors:** Displays a list of all doctors stored in the database.
4. **Book Appointments:** Enables booking an appointment between a patient and a doctor, ensuring the doctor's availability on the specified date.
5. **Exit:** Closes the application and database connection safely.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Database:** MySQL
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **JDBC Driver:** MySQL Connector/J

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure JDK is installed and configured.
2. **MySQL Server:** Installed and running with access to MySQL Workbench or Shell.
3. **MySQL JDBC Driver:** Add the MySQL Connector/J `.jar` file to your project.
4. **Database Setup:** Create the required database and tables.

---

## Database Setup

1. **Create a Database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hospital;
   ```
2. **Use the Database:**
   ```sql
   USE hospital;
   ```
3. **Create Tables:**

   - **Patients Table:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE patients (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         age INT NOT NULL,
         gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
     );
     ```
   - **Doctors Table:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE doctors (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         specialty VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
     );
     ```
   - **Appointments Table:**
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE appointments (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         patient_id INT NOT NULL,
         doctor_id INT NOT NULL,
         appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
         FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id),
         FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id)
     );
     ```

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Project.**
2. **Add MySQL Connector/J:**
   - Place the `.jar` file in a `lib` folder in your project directory.
   - Add the `.jar` file to the project classpath.
3. **Update Database Credentials:**
   - Modify the following fields in the `HospitalManagement` class:
     ```java
     private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital";
     private static final String username = "your_mysql_username";
     private static final String password = "your_mysql_password";
     ```
4. **Compile and Run:**
   ```bash
   javac -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar" src/*.java
   java -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar;src" HospitalManagement
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. Upon running the program, you'll see the **Hospital Management System** menu.
2. Choose an option by entering the corresponding number:
   - To **Add a Patient**, provide the patient's name, age, and gender.
   - To **View Patients**, all patients in the database will be displayed.
   - To **View Doctors**, all doctors in the database will be displayed.
   - To **Book an Appointment**, enter the patient ID, doctor ID, and appointment date. The program will check the doctor's availability.
   - To **Exit**, choose option `5` to close the application and the database connection.

## Learning Objectives

1. **JDBC Connection:** Understand how to connect Java with MySQL using JDBC.
2. **CRUD Operations:** Learn to perform basic CRUD operations on a database.
3. **Prepared Statements:** Avoid SQL injection and handle dynamic queries securely.
4. **Modular Programming:** Separate concerns using different classes for patients, doctors, and main operations.

---

## Limitations

- Basic validation is implemented; further checks can be added.
- No GUI; this is a console-based application.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add more features like patient and doctor search, updating records, and deleting records.
- Introduce a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Implement advanced appointment scheduling features.
